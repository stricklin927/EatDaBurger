MSU - Homework 13: Eat Da Burger App (Node Express Handlebars)

## Overview
For this project I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The MVC design pattern was followed. Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in the app. Handlebars were used to generate the HTML.
